This repository is related to the application of the Fuzzy C-means algorithm to perform Quantum Measurement Error Mitigation (QMEM). This approach is proposed in:


**''G. Acampora and A. Vitiello, "Error Mitigation in Quantum Measurement through Fuzzy C-Means Clustering,"
    in 2021 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), Luxembourg, Luxembourg, 2021, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/FUZZ45933.2021.9494538.''**
    
 

# Example
